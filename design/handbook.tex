\section{Scoping}

\subsection{Problem Statement}

Online tutorials generally offer step-by-step solutions to accomplishing specific tasks. Users often read and perform steps concurrently as opposed to reviewing the tutorial and following the instructions from memory. As a result, a lot of time is spent context-switching between executing tasks and reading the instructions. Further more, switching between performing and reviewing a step is more difficult to do when the task is physically demanding.


\subsection{Purpose Statement}

In addition to keeping track of tutorials, a comprehensive interface that lends itself to semi-automated guidance through the tutorial would be beneficial to many users. Ideally the user would have limited physical interaction with the device in order to retain focus on executing an instruction. Handbook aims to present a user interface geared towards a design that maximizes productivity when reviewing and executing a tutorial.  

\subsection{Stakeholders}

Stakeholders include the owner and software developer Mayank Sindwani as well users willing to actively use the application. The owner will facilitate the design and development process while end users will continuously provide feedback during development.

\subsection{Constraints}

Handbook is subject to the following constraints:

\begin{itemize}

\item The software must operate under the functionality constraints of the android platform including limited file system access and memory.
\item Resources saved and used by the software must fall within the constraints enforced by the user's operating system and machine.
\item The software must not obstruct the methods by which a user may iterate through instructions manually

\end{itemize}

\section{Functional (Atomic) Requirements}

Handbook aims to include the following top priority requirements as elicited from stakeholders:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item The system should allow users to perform CRUD operations on tutorials
\item The system should accept voice commands to navigate tutorials and instructions
\end{itemize}

Lower priority items include user preference configurations, export and import features, intelligent space usage, and data analysis.

\section{Styleguide}

Handbook follows Google's material design guidelines. See the \href{https://material.io/color/#!/?view.left=1&view.right=1&primary.color=363b41&secondary.color=ad555a}{material styleguide} for colour scheme and accessibility details. The colour scheme is dark gray as the primary colour and red as the secondary. 
The text colour on dark gray colours is white while red colours use white text. 

\section{Data and Storage}

Handbook uses a SQLite relational database as part of the built-in Android functionality. Using the relational database as opposed to binary files offers better performance and granular data extraction better suited for navigating content throughout the application.
